            <h3>Benefits of getting Blockchain Development Service</h3>    
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12 mt-4">
            <h4>1. Greater transparency</h4>
            <p>
            Blockchain technology enables every transaction to be stored in a decentralized ledger, an ideal example being Bitcoin’s blockchain. This way, people and businesses can track transactions with more transparency and security. With proper usage of cryptographic protocols, however, it is possible to protect privacy when needed.            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12 mt-4">
            <h4>2. Better reliability</h4>
            <p>
            Some businesses have been crippled, even destroyed, by bugs in their code. If you can’t be sure your program will work when you click publish, it’s better to have someone else build it. Today’s development services come with guarantees on everything from uptime to compatibility.             </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12 mt-4">
            <h4>3. Faster transactions</h4>
            <p>
            With no intermediaries, blockchain transactions can be processed much faster. This process is time-consuming because multiple parties are involved. Moreover, as information has to pass through many hands, there’s always room for human error. Since every block gets added at once in a blockchain system, they get validated almost instantaneously.            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12 mt-4">
            <h4>4. Lower risk of fraud and error</h4>
            <p>
            There’s no way to change or edit information on a blockchain, making it far more difficult for fraudsters to steal your data. That doesn’t mean it can’t be hacked, but with blockchain technology, it would require an unfathomably large amount of computing power to pull off. A government. And we all know how trustworthy governments are when it comes to hacking...            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12 mt-4">
            <h4>5. Better security</h4>
            <p>
            Since a blockchain is a decentralized database, it’s much harder for hackers to break in and steal valuable information. Its decentralized structure also makes tampering almost impossible. As it is stored in millions of places across its network, any changes made on one computer will be met with resistance from other computers on its network.         </p>

            <p>
            Blockchain developers are hard to find. There’s such a high demand for them, companies can afford to be picky. This isn’t true of most other tech jobs. If you want an iOS developer, for example, there are tons of companies who need your skills—they just need you to make your phone work on their network. Blockchain development, on the other hand, is complex and risky; it requires specific expertise, and that means you have options when it comes to hiring a company.          </p>
