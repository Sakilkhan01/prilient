            A business that does not keep up to date with its software will see its competitive advantage decline over time. Competitive advantages can include taking advantage of new technology in a way that gives you better customer service, an innovative product or service, or a lower price. If your business relies on an outdated software system that doesn't let you be as competitive as you'd like, it may be time to upgrade.
