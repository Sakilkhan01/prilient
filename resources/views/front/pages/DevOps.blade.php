Before beginning to write any code, it’s important to have a solid plan that identifies short-term goals and long-term strategies as well as the resources needed to achieve those goals. So before getting started, make sure everyone involved understands what needs to happen on a high level and develop an action plan so there are no surprises when moving forward with coding.
