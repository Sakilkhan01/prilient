            <p>
            A lot of companies make their app to match specific products and services, and it’s something we really don’t recommend. Your app should be designed in such a way that it can stand on its own, or serve as an additional tool to your product/service offering. By offering exceptional experiences, you won’t need to rely on convincing users they need your app; they will use it because they want to use it.
